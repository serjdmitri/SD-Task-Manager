# Task Manager Project – Intro to Python (10th Grade Final Project)

At the start of 10th grade, I completed a final project for my Intro to Python class. We could choose from three project ideas, and I picked to make a task manager. I built it by myself using Python in IDLE.

My task manager lets users add tasks, mark them as complete, and quit the app using simple buttons. The design is clean and easy to use, with a menu that shows the options clearly.

I used Python lists to keep track of tasks, loops to keep the app running, and if-statements to make the buttons work. Right now, you can’t delete or edit tasks, but I might add that later as I learn more.

This project helped me practice important Python skills and taught me how to build a full program from beginning to end.
